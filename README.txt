FILE ENCRYPTION
In cryptography, a Caesar cipher, also known as Caesar's cipher, the shift cipher, Caesar code
or Caesar shift, is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a
type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some
fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a left shift of 3, 'D' wold be
replaced by 'A', 'E' would become 'B', and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who
used it in private correspondence. The following program is used to encrypt text files following
Caesar's cipher.
